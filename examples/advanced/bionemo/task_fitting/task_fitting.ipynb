In this paper, the authors developed a machine learning algorithm to predict the subcellular location of proteins from sequence through protein langage models that are similar to those hosted by BioNeMo. Protein subcellular location refers to where the protein localizes in the cell, for example a protein my be expressed in the Nucleus or in the Cytoplasm. Knowing where proteins localize can provide insights into the underlying mechanisms of cellular processes and help identify potential targets for drug development. The following image includes a few examples of subcellular locations in an animal cell:\n",

In other words, if we input 10 sequences, we will obtain a matrix `10xD`, where `D` is the size of the embedding (in the case of ESM-1nv, `D=768`). At a glance, these real-valued vector embeddings don't show any obvious features (see the printout in the next cell). But these vectors do contain information that can be used in downstream models to reveal properties of the protein, for example the subcellular location as we'll explore below."

    "To be able to classify proteins for their subcellular location, we train a simple scikit-learn Multi-layer Perceptron (MPL) classifier. The MLP model uses a network of hidden layers to fit the input embedding vectors to the model classes (the cellular locations above). In the call below, we define the MLP to use the Adam optimizer with a network of 32 hidden layers, defining a random state (or seed) for reproducibility, and trained for a maximum of 500 iterations.\n",
